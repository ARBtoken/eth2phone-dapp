		<br/>
                <h3 >What is it all about?</h3>

                <p>
		    Eth2phone allows anyone send and receive ether with minimal knowledge of cryptocurrency transaction mechanics.			
		</p>
		<p>
		    Got a friend, who’s not owning ether, yet? Go ahead and send him ether! All he needs is enter the receive tabs and follow simple steps, he’d even create the wallet instantly straight from there.
		</p>

                <h3 >The magic behind UI</h3>

                <p>
		    We put 2 things in priority here : <strong> simplicity </strong> and <strong> safety. </strong>
		</p>
		<p>
		    We’ve written the smart contract that allows you to send ether, verifying the receiver via SMS. In case of mistake, it allows you to cancel the transaction until it was received (has «awaiting receiving» status).
		</p>
		<h4> Safety </h4>
		<p>
		    The smart contract is built in a way that ether can be transferred only by the verification server with receiver’s address signed by a “verification private key”. Receiver only sends the address signed by verification private key to server, but not the verification private key. This means that not at any point the server has access to verification private key and to move ether to an illegal address.
		</p>

		<h4> Simplicity </h4>
		<p>
		    Receiver doesn’t need to have a wallet, it could be generated on-the-fly, and funds will be transferred to it. The system is as simple as it was possible - just select the action - send/receive and follow couple simple steps.
		</p>
